      <p> over the last several years my friend Methu Dube and I have been discussing and attempting the creation of some kind of comic. His pursuit of writing has had a similar path to my drawing, distracted and undirected at times but always returning at some point. Please enjoy a preview of our process as we continue working on this project. </p>
