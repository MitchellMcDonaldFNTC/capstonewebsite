    <p> Following along with tutorials and courses is an excellent way to improve quickly. The knowledge given is not very impressive, but  this is not the reason to use a tutorial. It has been my experience that artists love and prefer to draw what they are good at. This is not a good way to learn or improve. By surrendering yourself to not choosing what you will draw you will explore far more shapes and configurations than before. Another benefit is a Karate Kid effect, by starting with small simple objects a tutorial can trick  you into practicing the basics before giving you a more complicated challenge.
