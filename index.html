      <p> <em>Art</em> has been an on and off pursuit throughout my life. Despite pursuing it several times via school I have been unable to settle upon it, other schooling or work either getting in the way or simply distracting me from the pursuit. Carving out time and space to pursue this mode of <em>expression</em> has become more and more important to me over the last few years. Even if I am unable to make art my proffession it is a required part of my mental stability. Drawing, photography, and mixed media sculpture have been my main veins of exploration historically. However, recently I have begun to practice traditional beadwork with my family. Story telling has been a continual passion of mine. Through collaboration with my good friend Methu Dube I look forward to exploring the combination of the visual and the literary mediums.</p>
